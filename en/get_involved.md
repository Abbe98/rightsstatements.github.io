# Get Involved

RightsStatements.org is a joint initiative by [Europeana](http://europeana.eu/) and the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/) (DPLA). We intend to develop a set of standardized rights statements that answers the needs of cultural heritage institutions and aggregators across the globe. To facilitate this we are working on setting up an open governance model that will enable other interested parties to participate in the further development of RightsStatements.org. If you are interested in contributing to the rights statements, or if you have questions related to the project or our rights statements, please get in touch via [info@rightsstatements.org](mailto:info@rightsstatements.org).

There are currently two active working groups. The International Rights Statements Working Group and its Technical sub-group.
