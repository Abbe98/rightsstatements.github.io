Our rights statements are supported by major aggregation platforms such as the Digital Public Library of America and Europeana.eu. The rights statements have been designed with both human users and machine users (such as search engines) in mind and make use of state of the art semantic webs technology.

#For users
Our rights statements are used by cultural heritage institutions to communicate the copyright and reuse status of works from their collections that they make available online. These rights statements have been standardized so that they can be used by cultural heritage institutions around the world. They have been designed to be easy to understand and provide you with information that clearly states if and how you can use works that you encounter online. These rights statements have been designed specifically for use by cultural heritage institutions and are not intended to be used to be used with your own creations. If you are looking for a way to license your own creation we encourage you to take a look at the licenses provided by [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org){:target="_blank"}.
