# Translations of the rights statements

The rights statements and underlying infrastructure of rightsstatements.org have been designed to work internationally in many languages. At the moment our rights statements are only available in English. If you are interested in working with us on translating the rights statements please contact us at [info@rightstatesments.org](mailto:info@rightstatesments.org). Translations of the rights statements need to be produced in line with our translation policy which you can find below.

## Rightsstatements.org translation policy 
### Last updated: 12-06-2017

This document outlines the procedure for dealing with translations of the rights statements provided by rightsstatements.org. Currently there are no plans for rightsstatements.org to undertake translations on its own. Instead we endeavour to work with external partners ('translation partners') on translating the suite of rights statements into other languages.
 
The aim of this policy is to ensure that we achieve the best possible translations and that translations have are of comparable quality to the original English language version. This policy does not deal with technical issues related to translations of the rights statements; rather, it has been drafted in the understanding that the rightsstatements.org backend can handle translations in an unlimited number of languages, provided that the translations follow the requirements specified in the technical white paper (i.e., language codes are specified according to BCP47, and with translated text represented in a UTF-8 encoding).

### General principles

* A translation partner must translate all rights statements that are offered by rightsstatements.org when the translation effort is undertaken. We do not allow selective translation of a subset of rights statements even if some of the rights statements may not be applicable in the areas where the target language is practiced. 
* A translation partner should in principle commit to translate additional rights statements that become available after an initial translation has been completed.
* In addition to the translation of the text of the rights statements themselves a translation of the text of [rightsstatements.org/vocab/1.0/](/vocab/1.0/?language=en) is required. We encourage translation partners to translate the text of the homepage and of [rightsstatements.org/en/about/](/en/about.html)
* Translation partners can either be individuals or organisations. Translation partners will be given credit on the acknowledgments page of the the website (with a hyperlink). 
* New translations do not constitute new versions. New translations will be added to the changelog on the website.

### Procedure:

To ensure a consistent quality of translations, rightsstatements.org applies the following procedure for translations. Each subsequent step of the procedure requires express approval from the chair(s) of the International Rights Statements Working Group. Rightsstatements.org reserves the right to not to proceed to a subsequent step if it there are reason to believe that the quality of the translation is not good enough or if it cannot ascertain the quality of a translation.

1. Prospective translation partner indicates its intention to undertake a translation to a representative of rightsstatements.org. The prospective translation partner should provide a motivation and a description of the person(s) who will be undertaking the translation. The application must include a letter of support by at least one other person who commits to review the translation. 
2. The Statements Working Group reviews the expression of interest. If satisfied it will formally notify the translation partner and provide the translation partner with a template document to populate with the translated text.
3.The translation partner supplies the completed template document to the reviewer(s) identified in step 1, and once agreed the translation partner notifies rightsstatements.org of the completion of the draft translation.
4.Rightsstatements.org reviews the draft translation. Depending on the language, this can either happen 'in house' or with the help of an external partner with the required language skills. If the review results in any comments or suggestions for feedback these are communicated back to the translation partner and the reviewer(s) identified in step 1 to be addressed or resolved by them as appropriate. 
5. Once a final draft is agreed by the Statements Working Group, the translation partner is informed. The draft translation will then be published for a public comment period of 4 weeks. Both rightststatements.org and the translation partner commit to informing the public about the ability to comment via social media accounts and via their relevant professional networks in order to ensure feedback from a wide range of sources is received.
6. The feedback from the public comment period will be addressed by the translation partner together with the reviewer(s) identified in step 1 and presented to the Statements Working Group. Changes that are implemented as a result of  public comments need to be tracked and a rationale for such changes needs to be provided by the translation partner (in English). Once the public comments have been addressed to the satisfaction of the translation partner, reviewer and the Statements Working Group, the translation will be accepted.
7. The technical team implements translation on a staging server and asks the translation partner to review the published translation. Once the translation partner has approved the published translation it will be pushed to the live server, the changelog will be updated with the new translation and (if desired) the credits to the translation team will be added to the changelog entry.  

If you have any questions related to our translation policy or if you want to provide feedback on existing translations please contact us at [info@rightstatesments.org](mailto:info@rightstatesments.org).
